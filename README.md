Paper soccer
============

Team project for Software Engineering course from my Bachelor studies
at Warsaw University of Technology.

Aim of this project was to implement a digital version of paper soccer game following a given
Universal Game System specification.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_soccer if you never heard of it. It's quite popular
(or at least was quite popular) school game in Poland.

This implementation of the game was not played by human players, however, but by AI. Each team
implemented their AI and communication routines (following the protocol described in specs)
and lanuchend game instances were playing automatically with each other over LAN.
